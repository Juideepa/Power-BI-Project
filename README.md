# Power-BI-Project
E commerce sales dashboard
I created an Ecommerce Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize sales performance of an online store. The dashboard provides key insights such as total sales amount, total quantity sold, and total profit using KPI cards. It includes interactive filters like Quarter-wise and State-wise slicers to view performance for specific regions and time periods. I also built visualizations to analyze profit by month, profit by category and sub-category and quantity distribution by category. Additionally, the dashboard highlights customer payment preferences through payment mode analysis (COD, UPI, Debit Card, Credit Card). This project helps in understanding sales trends, identifying high-performing products, and supporting data-driven business decisions.
